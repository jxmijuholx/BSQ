Explanation of each part:

CC: Specifies the compiler to use.
CFLAGS: Compiler flags to be used.
TARGET: Name of the executable.
SRCS: List of source files.
OBJS: List of object files.
all: Default target, builds the executable.
$(TARGET): Specifies the executable depends on object files.
$(OBJS): Specifies object files depend on source files.
%.o: %.c: Pattern rule to build object files from corresponding source files.
clean: Target to clean object files.
fclean: Target to clean object files and executable.
re: Target to perform a clean build.

To use this Makefile, place it in the same directory as your source files
(main.c, parse.c, validate.c, find_square.c, print_map.c),
and then run make command in the terminal.
This will compile your program into an executable named bsq.
You can also run make clean to remove the object files,
make fclean to remove both object files and the executable,
and make re to perform a clean build.
